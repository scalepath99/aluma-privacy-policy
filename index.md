## 11. SMS / TEXT MESSAGING (OPT-IN & OPT-OUT)

### 11.1 Purpose and Types of Messages
If you opt in to receive SMS/text messages, we may send: (a) transactional notifications (e.g., account, order, reminders, support follow-ups) and (b) occasional service updates. We do not send high-frequency marketing blasts.

### 11.2 Express Consent (Opt-In)
We only send texts after **express consent**. You can provide consent by:
- Checking an **unchecked** box during sign-up/checkout or in account settings (with clear disclosure); and/or
- Completing a **double opt-in**: after you submit your number, we send  
  “Reply **YES** to confirm SMS updates. **STOP** to opt out. **HELP** for help. Msg & data rates may apply.”  
  Your subscription is activated only after we receive **YES**.

### 11.3 Opt-Out & Help
You may opt out at any time by replying **STOP**. For assistance, reply **HELP**. You can also manage preferences inside the App or contact us at **scalepathtools@gmail.com**. Opt-out does not affect non-SMS communications you choose to receive (e.g., email, in-app).

### 11.4 Frequency & Charges
Message frequency varies by usage (e.g., reminders you enable). **Message and data rates may apply** from your carrier.

### 11.5 Compliance
We follow applicable rules such as **LGPD/GDPR** principles, **ANATEL** guidelines (Brazil), and **TCPA/CTIA** requirements (U.S. A2P 10DLC). Each message identifies our brand and includes **STOP/HELP** instructions.

### 11.6 Data We Process for SMS
For SMS operations we process: mobile phone number, carrier metadata, message content, timestamps, delivery status, consent/opt-in and opt-out logs, and IP/user agent when consent is captured via web/app.

### 11.7 Processors / Service Providers
We use reputable messaging providers (e.g., SMS gateways) solely to deliver texts and manage compliance. They act as our **data processors** under contractual safeguards.

### 11.8 Separate Channels
WhatsApp or similar channels require **separate** consent and follow their own policies. Opting out of SMS does not automatically opt you out of those channels (and vice versa).
